#KDR website reboot

Since I have time on my hands this summer and my interest in Rails as a platform
has since peeked, I decided to revamp the KDR website, of which I was webmaster
over the last year but lacked sufficient time to work on it. The project takes a
chunk of inspiration from work that *Dabell* had started looking at during the
spring semester of 2011. 

The end project is intended to have a similar layout as the current website. It
should allow for a bulk of the editing and updating of the website to be done by
persons other than the current webmaster. It is therefore hopeful that the new
and (hopefully) improved website will become easier to maintain leading to a
more relevant and up to date information.

At the very least, I expect this to be a fun learning experience that I can use
to create even more complex problems.
